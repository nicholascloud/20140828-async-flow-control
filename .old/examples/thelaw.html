  <p style="text-align: justify">When a reviewer wishes to give special recognition to a book, he predicts that it will still be read &quot;a hundred years from now.&quot; <i>The Law</i>, first published as a pamphlet in June, 1850, is already more
  than a hundred years old. And because its truths are eternal, it will still be read when another century has passed. Frederic Bastiat (1801-1850) was a French economist, statesman, and author. He did most of his writing during the years just
  before &#8212; and immediately following &#8212; the Revolution of February 1848. This was the period when France was rapidly turning to complete socialism. As a Deputy to the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Bastiat was studying and explaining each
  socialist fallacy as it appeared. And he explained how socialism must inevitably degenerate into communism. But most of his countrymen chose to ignore his logic. <i>The Law</i> is here presented again because the same situation exists in America
  today as in the France of 1848. The same socialist-communist ideas and plans that were then adopted in France are now sweeping America. The explanations and arguments then advanced against socialism by Mr. Bastiat are &#8212; word for word &#8212;
  equally valid today. His ideas deserve a serious hearing.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">This translation of <i>The Law</i> was done by Dean Russell of The Foundation staff. His objective was an accurate rendering of Mr. Bastiat&#39;s words and ideas into twentieth century, idiomatic English.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">A nineteenth century translation of <i>The Law,</i> made in 1853 in England by an unidentified contemporary of Mr. Bastiat, was of much value as a check against this translation. In addition, Dean Russell had his
  work reviewed by Bertrand de Jouvenel, the noted French economist, historian, and author who is also thoroughly familiar with the English language.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">While Mr. de Jouvenel offered many valuable corrections and suggestions, it should be clearly understood that Dr. Russell bears full responsibility for the translation.</p>

  every kind of greed! Instead of checking crime, the law itself guilty of the evils it is supposed to punish!</em></p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">We hold from God the gift which includes all others. This gift is life &#8212; physical, intellectual, and moral life.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But life cannot maintain itself alone. The Creator of life has entrusted us with the responsibility of preserving, developing, and perfecting it. In order that we may accomplish this, He has provided us with a
  collection of marvelous faculties. And He has put us in the midst of a variety of natural resources. By the application of our faculties to these natural resources we convert them into products, and use them. This process is necessary in order
  that life may run its appointed course.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Life, faculties, production &#8212; in other words, individuality, liberty, property &#8212; this is man. And in spite of the cunning of artful political leaders, these three gifts from God precede all human
  legislation, and are superior to it. Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first
  place.</p><a name="SECTION_G004"></a>

    </tr>
  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">What, then, is law? It is the collective organization of the individual right to lawful defense.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Each of us has a natural right &#8212; from God &#8212; to defend his person, his liberty, and his property. These are the three basic requirements of life, and the preservation of any one of them is completely
  dependent upon the preservation of the other two. For what are our faculties but the extension of our individuality? And what is property but an extension of our faculties? If every person has the right to defend even by force &#8212; his person,
  his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly. Thus the principle of collective right &#8212; its reason for existing, its lawfulness
  &#8212; is based on individual right. And the common force that protects this collective right cannot logically have any other purpose or any other mission than that for which it acts as a substitute. Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use
  force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force &#8212; for the same reason &#8212; cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Such a perversion of force would be, in both cases, contrary to our premise. Force has been given to us to defend our own individual rights. Who will dare to say that force has been given to us to destroy the equal
  rights of our brothers? Since no individual acting separately can lawfully use force to destroy the rights of others, does it not logically follow that the same principle also applies to the common force that is nothing more than the organized
  combination of the individual forces?</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">If this is true, then nothing can be more evident than this: The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force
  is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause <em>justice</em> to reign over us all.</p><a name="SECTION_G005"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">If a nation were founded on this basis, it seems to me that order would prevail among the people, in thought as well as in deed. It seems to me that such a nation would have the most simple, easy to accept,
  economical, limited, nonoppressive, just, and enduring government imaginable &#8212; whatever its political form might be.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Under such an administration, everyone would understand that he possessed all the privileges as well as all the responsibilities of his existence. No one would have any argument with government, provided that his
  person was respected, his labor was free, and the fruits of his labor were protected against all unjust attack. When successful, we would not have to thank the state for our success. And, conversely, when unsuccessful, we would no more think of
  blaming the state for our misfortune than would the farmers blame the state because of hail or frost. The state would be felt only by the invaluable blessings of safety provided by this concept of government.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">It can be further stated that, thanks to the non-intervention of the state in private affairs, our wants and their satisfactions would develop themselves in a logical manner. We would not see poor families seeking
  literary instruction before they have bread. We would not see cities populated at the expense of rural districts, nor rural districts at the expense of cities. We would not see the great displacements of capital, labor, and population that are
  caused by legislative decisions.</p>

    </tr>
  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But, unfortunately, law by no means confines itself to its proper functions. And when it has exceeded its proper functions, it has not done so merely in some inconsequential and debatable matters. The law has gone
  further than this; it has acted in direct opposition to its own purpose. The law has been used to destroy its own objective: It has been applied to annihilating the justice that it was supposed to maintain; to limiting and destroying rights which
  its real purpose was to respect. The law has placed the collective force at the disposal of the unscrupulous who wish, without risk, to exploit the person, liberty, and property of others. It has converted plunder into a right, in order to protect
  plunder. And it has converted lawful defense into a crime, in order to punish lawful defense.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">How has this perversion of the law been accomplished? And what have been the results?</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">The law has been perverted by the influence of two entirely different causes: stupid greed and false philanthropy. Let us speak of the first.</p><a name="SECTION_G007"></a>

  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Self-preservation and self-development are common aspirations among all people. And if everyone enjoyed the unrestricted use of his faculties and the free disposition of the fruits of his labor, social progress would
  be ceaseless, uninterrupted, and unfailing.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But there is also another tendency that is common among people. When they can, they wish to live and prosper at the expense of others. This is no rash accusation. Nor does it come from a gloomy and uncharitable
  spirit. The annals of history bear witness to the truth of it: the incessant wars, mass migrations, religious persecutions, universal slavery, dishonesty in commerce, and monopolies. This fatal desire has its origin in the very nature of man
  &#8212; in that primitive, universal, and insuppressible instinct that impels him to satisfy his desires with the least possible pain.</p><a name="SECTION_G008"></a>

  <table width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: #CCFFB8; font-weight: bold" valign="top">Property and Plunder</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Man can live and satisfy his wants only by ceaseless labor; by the ceaseless application of his faculties to natural resources. This process is the origin of property.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But it is also true that a man may live and satisfy his wants by seizing and consuming the products of the labor of others. This process is the origin of plunder.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Now since man is naturally inclined to avoid pain &#8212; and since labor is pain in itself &#8212; it follows that men will resort to plunder whenever plunder is easier than work. History shows this quite clearly.
  And under these conditions, neither religion nor morality can stop it.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">When, then, does plunder stop? It stops when it becomes more painful and more dangerous than labor.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">It is evident, then, that the proper purpose of law is to use the power of its collective force to stop this fatal tendency to plunder instead of to work. All the measures of the law should protect property and
  punish plunder.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But, generally, the law is made by one man or one class of men. And since law cannot operate without the sanction and support of a dominating force, this force must be entrusted to those who make the laws.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">This fact, combined with the fatal tendency that exists in the heart of man to satisfy his wants with the least possible effort, explains the almost universal perversion of the law. Thus it is easy to understand how
  law, instead of checking injustice, becomes the invincible weapon of injustice. It is easy to understand why the law is used by the legislator to destroy in varying degrees among the rest of the people, their personal independence by slavery,
  their liberty by oppression, and their property by plunder. This is done for the benefit of the person who makes the law, and in proportion to the power that he holds.</p><a name="SECTION_G009"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Men naturally rebel against the injustice of which they are victims. Thus, when plunder is organized by law for the profit of those who make the law, all the plundered classes try somehow to enter &#8212; by peaceful
  or revolutionary means &#8212; into the making of laws. According to their degree of enlightenment, these plundered classes may propose one of two entirely different purposes when they attempt to attain political power: Either they may wish to
  stop lawful plunder, or they may wish to share in it.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Woe to the nation when this latter purpose prevails among the mass victims of lawful plunder when they, in turn, seize the power to make laws! Until that happens, the few practice lawful plunder upon the many, a
  common practice where the right to participate in the making of law is limited to a few persons. But then, participation in the making of law becomes universal. And then, men seek to balance their conflicting interests by universal plunder.
  Instead of rooting out the injustices found in society, they make these injustices general. As soon as the plundered classes gain political power, they establish a system of reprisals against other classes. They do not abolish legal plunder. (This
  objective would demand more enlightenment than they possess.) Instead, they emulate their evil predecessors by participating in this legal plunder, even though it is against their own interests.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">It is as if it were necessary, before a reign of justice appears, for everyone to suffer a cruel retribution &#8212; some for their evilness, and some for their lack of understanding.</p><a name="SECTION_G010"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">It is impossible to introduce into society a greater change and a greater evil than this: the conversion of the law into an instrument of plunder.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">What are the consequences of such a perversion? It would require volumes to describe them all. Thus we must content ourselves with pointing out the most striking.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">In the first place, it erases from everyone&#39;s conscience the distinction between justice and injustice.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">No society can exist unless the laws are respected to a certain degree. The safest way to make laws respected is to make them respectable. When law and morality contradict each other, the citizen has the cruel
  alternative of either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law. These two evils are of equal consequence, and it would be difficult for a person to choose between them.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">The nature of law is to maintain justice. This is so much the case that, in the minds of the people, law and justice are one and the same thing. There is in all of us a strong disposition to believe that anything
  lawful is also legitimate. This belief is so widespread that many persons have erroneously held that things are &quot;just&quot; because law makes them so. Thus, in order to make plunder appear just and sacred to many consciences, it is only
  necessary for the law to decree and sanction it. Slavery, restrictions, and monopoly find defenders not only among those who profit from them but also among those who suffer from them.</p><a name="SECTION_G011"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">If you suggest a doubt as to the morality of these institutions, it is boldly said that &quot;You are a dangerous innovator, a utopian, a theorist, a subversive; you would shatter the foundation upon which society
  rests.&quot; If you lecture upon morality or upon political science, there will be found official organizations petitioning the government in this vein of thought: &quot;That science no longer be taught exclusively from the point of view of free
  trade (of liberty, of property, and of justice) as has been the case until now, but also, in the future, science is to be especially taught from the viewpoint of the facts and laws that regulate French industry (facts and laws which are contrary
  to liberty, to property, and to justice). That, in government-endowed teaching positions, the professor rigorously refrain from endangering in the slightest degree the respect due to the laws now in force.&quot; <a name="footnoteref1"></a><a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Thus, if there exists a law which sanctions slavery or monopoly, oppression or robbery, in any form whatever, it must not even be mentioned. For how can it be mentioned without damaging the respect which it inspires?
  Still further, morality and political economy must be taught from the point of view of this law; from the supposition that it must be a just law merely because it is a law.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Another effect of this tragic perversion of the law is that it gives an exaggerated importance to political passions and conflicts, and to politics in general.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">I could prove this assertion in a thousand ways. But, by way of illustration, I shall limit myself to a subject that has lately occupied the minds of everyone: universal suffrage.</p><a name="SECTION_G012"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">The followers of Rousseau&#39;s school of thought &#8212; who consider themselves far advanced, but whom I consider twenty centuries behind the times &#8212; will not agree with me on this. But universal suffrage
  &#8212; using the word in its strictest sense &#8212; is not one of those sacred dogmas which it is a crime to examine or doubt. In fact, serious objections may be made to universal suffrage.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">In the first place the word <em>universal</em> conceals a gross fallacy. For example, there are 36 million people in France. Thus, to make the right of suffrage universal, there should be 36 million voters. But the
  most extended system permits only 9 million people to vote. Three persons out of four are excluded. And more than this, they are excluded by the fourth. This fourth person advances the principle of <em>incapacity</em> as his reason for excluding
  the others.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Universal suffrage means, then, universal suffrage for those who are capable. But there remains this question of fact: Who is capable? Are minors, females, insane persons, and persons who have committed certain major
  crimes the only ones to be determined incapable?</p><a name="SECTION_G013"></a>

  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">A closer examination of the subject shows us the motive which causes the right of suffrage to be based upon the supposition of incapacity. The motive is that the elector or voter does not exercise this right for
  himself alone, but for everybody. The most extended elective system and the most restricted elective system are alike in this respect. They differ only in respect to what constitutes incapacity. It is not a difference of principle, but merely a
  difference of degree. If, as the republicans of our present-day Greek and Roman schools of thought pretend, the right of suffrage arrives with one&#39;s birth, it would be an injustice for adults to prevent women and children from voting. Why are
  they prevented? Because they are presumed to be incapable. And why is incapacity a motive for exclusion? Because it is not the voter alone who suffers the consequences of his vote; because each vote touches and affects everyone in the entire
  community; because the people in the community have a right to demand some safeguards concerning the acts upon which their welfare and existence depend.</p><a name="SECTION_G014"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">I know what might be said in answer to this; what the objections might be. But this is not the place to exhaust a controversy of this nature. I wish merely to observe here that this controversy over universal
  suffrage (as well as most other political questions) which agitates, excites, and overthrows nations, would lose nearly all of its importance if the law had always been what it ought to be. In fact, if law were restricted to protecting all

  <p style="text-align: justify">But on the other hand, imagine that this fatal principle has been introduced: Under the pretense of organization, regulation, protection, or encouragement, the law takes property from one person and gives it to
  another; the law takes the wealth of all and gives it to a few &#8212; whether farmers, manufacturers, ship owners, artists, or comedians. Under these circumstances, then certainly every class will aspire to grasp the law, and logically so.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">The excluded classes will furiously demand their right to vote &#8212; and will overthrow society rather than not to obtain it. Even beggars and vagabonds will then prove to you that they also have an incontestable
  title to vote. They will say to you:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">&quot;We cannot buy wine, tobacco, or salt without paying the tax. And a part of the tax that we pay is given by law &#8212; in privileges and subsidies &#8212; to men who are richer than we are. Others use the law
  to raise the prices of bread, meat, iron, or cloth. Thus, since everyone else uses the law for his own profit, we also would like to use the law for our own profit. We demand from the law the <em>right to relief</em>, which is the poor man&#39;s
  plunder. To obtain this right, we also should be voters and legislators in order that we may organize Beggary on a grand scale for our own class, as you have organized Protection on a grand scale for your class. Now don&#39;t tell us beggars that
  you will act for us, and then toss us, as Mr. Mimerel proposes, 600,000 francs to keep us quiet, like throwing us a bone to gnaw. We have other claims. And anyway, we wish to bargain for ourselves as other classes have bargained for

  <p style="text-align: justify">But of what plunder was he speaking? For there are two kinds of plunder: legal and illegal.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">I do not think that illegal plunder, such as theft or swindling &#8212; which the penal code defines, anticipates, and punishes &#8212; can be called socialism. It is not this kind of plunder that systematically
  threatens the foundations of society. Anyway, the war against this kind of plunder has not waited for the command of these gentlemen. The war against illegal plunder has been fought since the beginning of the world. Long before the Revolution of
  February 1848 &#8212; long before the appearance even of socialism itself &#8212; France had provided police, judges, gendarmes, prisons, dungeons, and scaffolds for the purpose of fighting illegal plunder. The law itself conducts this war, and it

  <p style="text-align: justify">This legal plunder may be only an isolated stain among the legislative measures of the people. If so, it is best to wipe it out with a minimum of speeches and denunciations &#8212; and in spite of the uproar of the

  at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Then abolish this law without delay, for it is not only an evil itself, but also it is a fertile source for further evils because it invites reprisals. If such a law &#8212; which may be an isolated case &#8212; is
  not abolished immediately, it will spread, multiply, and develop into a system.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">The person who profits from this law will complain bitterly, defending his <em>acquired rights</em>. He will claim that the state is obligated to protect and encourage his particular industry; that this procedure
  enriches the state because the protected industry is thus able to spend more and to pay higher wages to the poor workingmen.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Do not listen to this sophistry by vested interests. The acceptance of these arguments will build legal plunder into a whole system. In fact, this has already occurred. The present-day delusion is an attempt to

  <p style="text-align: justify">But why does not Mr. de Montalembert see that he has placed himself in a vicious circle? You would use the law to oppose socialism? But it is upon the law that socialism itself relies. Socialists desire to practice

  <p style="text-align: justify">I say that this act is exactly what the law is supposed to suppress, always and everywhere. When the law itself commits this act that it is supposed to suppress, I say that plunder is still committed, and I add that

  <p style="text-align: justify">But when the law, by means of its necessary agent, force, imposes upon men a regulation of labor, a method or a subject of education, a religious faith or creed &#8212; then the law is no longer negative; it acts

  <p style="text-align: justify">Present-day writers &#8212; especially those of the socialist school of thought &#8212; base their various theories upon one common hypothesis: They divide mankind into two parts. People in general &#8212; with the
  exception of the writer himself &#8212; form the first group. The writer, all alone, forms the second and most important group. Surely this is the weirdest and most conceited notion that ever entered a human brain!</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">In fact, these writers on public affairs begin by supposing that people have within themselves no means of discernment; no motivation to action. The writers assume that people are inert matter, passive particles,
  motionless atoms, at best a kind of vegetation indifferent to its own manner of existence. They assume that people are susceptible to being shaped &#8212; by the will and hand of another person &#8212; into an infinite variety of forms, more or
  less symmetrical, artistic, and perfected. Moreover, not one of these writers on governmental affairs hesitates to imagine that he himself &#8212; under the title of organizer, discoverer, legislator, or founder &#8212; is this will and hand, this
  universal motivating force, this creative power whose sublime mission is to mold these scattered materials &#8212; persons &#8212; into a society.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">These socialist writers look upon people in the same manner that the gardener views his trees. Just as the gardener capriciously shapes the trees into pyramids, parasols, cubes, vases, fans, and other forms, just so
  does the socialist writer whimsically shape human beings into groups, series, centers, sub-centers, honeycombs, labor-corps, and other variations. And just as the gardener needs axes, pruning hooks, saws, and shears to shape his trees, just so
  does the socialist writer need the force that he can find only in law to shape human beings. For this purpose, he devises tariff laws, tax laws, relief laws, and school laws.</p><a name="SECTION_G037"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Socialists look upon people as raw material to be formed into social combinations. This is so true that, if by chance, the socialists have any doubts about the success of these combinations, they will demand that a
  small portion of mankind be set aside <em>to experiment upon</em>. The popular idea of trying <em>all systems</em> is well known. And one socialist leader has been known seriously to demand that the Constituent Assembly give him a small district
  with all its inhabitants, to try his experiments upon.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">In the same manner, an inventor makes a model before he constructs the full-sized machine; the chemist wastes some chemicals &#8212; the farmer wastes some seeds and land &#8212; to try out an idea.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But what a difference there is between the gardener and his trees, between the inventor and his machine, between the chemist and his elements, between the farmer and his seeds! And in all sincerity, the socialist
  thinks that there is the same difference between him and mankind!</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">It is no wonder that the writers of the nineteenth century look upon society as an artificial creation of the legislator&#39;s genius. This idea &#8212; the fruit of classical education &#8212; has taken possession
  of all the intellectuals and famous writers of our country. To these intellectuals and writers, the relationship between persons and the legislator appears to be the same as the relationship between the clay and the potter.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Moreover, even where they have consented to recognize a principle of action in the heart of man &#8212; and a principle of discernment in man&#39;s intellect &#8212; they have considered these gifts from God to be
  fatal gifts. They have thought that persons, under the impulse of these two gifts, would fatally tend to ruin themselves. They assume that if the legislators left persons free to follow their own inclinations, they would arrive at atheism instead
  of religion, ignorance instead of knowledge, poverty instead of production and exchange.</p><a name="SECTION_G038"></a>

  sake of the rest of the world! While mankind tends toward evil, the legislators yearn for good; while mankind advances toward darkness, the legislators aspire for enlightenment; while mankind is drawn toward vice, the legislators are attracted
  toward virtue. Since they have decided that this is the true state of affairs, they then demand the use of force in order to substitute their own inclinations for those of the human race.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Open at random any book on philosophy, politics, or history, and you will probably see how deeply rooted in our country is this idea &#8212; the child of classical studies, the mother of socialism. In all of them,
  you will probably find this idea that mankind is merely inert matter, receiving life, organization, morality, and prosperity from the power of the state. And even worse, it will be stated that mankind tends toward degeneration, and is stopped from
  this downward course only by the mysterious hand of the legislator. Conventional classical thought everywhere says that behind passive society there is a concealed power called <em>law</em> or <em>legislator</em> (or called by some other
  terminology that designates some unnamed person or persons of undisputed influence and authority) which moves, controls, benefits, and improves mankind.</p><a name="SECTION_G039"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Let us first consider a quotation from Bossuet [tutor to the Dauphin in the Court of Louis XIV] <a name="footnoteref5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    One of the things most strongly impressed (by whom?) upon the minds of the Egyptians was patriotism.... No one was permitted to be useless to the state. The law assigned to each one his work, which was handed down from father to son. No one was
    permitted to have two professions. Nor could a person change from one job to another.... But there was one task to which all were forced to conform: the study of the laws and of wisdom. Ignorance of religion and of the political regulations of
    the country was not excused under any circumstances. Moreover, each occupation was assigned (by whom?) to a certain district.... Among the good laws, one of the best was that everyone was trained (by whom?) to obey them. As a result of this,
    Egypt was filled with wonderful inventions, and nothing was neglected that could make life easy and quiet.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Thus, according to Bossuet, persons derive nothing from themselves. Patriotism, prosperity, inventions, husbandry, science &#8212; all of these are given to the people by the operation of the laws, the rulers. All
  that the people have to do is to bow to leadership.</p><a name="SECTION_G040"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Bossuet carries this idea of the state as the source of all progress even so far as to defend the Egyptians against the charge that they rejected wrestling and music. He said:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    How is that possible? These arts were invented by Trismegistus [who was alleged to have been Chancellor to the Egyptian god Osiris].
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify">And again among the Persians, Bossuet claims that all comes from above:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    One of the first responsibilities <em>of the prince</em> was to encourage agriculture.... Just as there were offices established for the regulation of armies, just so were there offices for the direction of farm work.... The Persian people
    <em>were inspired</em> with an overwhelming respect for royal authority.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify">And according to Bossuet, the Greek people, although exceedingly intelligent, had no sense of personal responsibility; like dogs and horses, they themselves could not have invented the most simple games:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    The Greeks, naturally intelligent and courageous, <em>had been early cultivated</em> by the kings and settlers who had come from Egypt. From these Egyptian rulers, the Greek people had learned bodily exercises, <em>foot races</em>, and horse and
    chariot races.... But the best thing that the Egyptians had taught the Greeks was to become docile, and to permit themselves to be formed by the law for the public good.

  <p style="text-align: justify">It cannot be disputed that these classical theories [advanced by these latter-day teachers, writers, legislators, economists, and philosophers] held that everything came to the people from a source outside
  themselves. As another example, take Fenelon [archbishop, author, and instructor to the Duke of Burgundy].</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">He was a witness to the power of Louis XIV. This, plus the fact that he was nurtured in the classical studies and the admiration of antiquity, naturally caused Fenelon to accept the idea that mankind should be
  passive; that the misfortunes and the prosperity &#8212; vices and virtues &#8212; of people are caused by the external influence exercised upon them by the law and the legislators. Thus, in his <em>Utopia of Salentum</em>, he puts men &#8212;
  with all their interests, faculties, desires, and possessions under the absolute discretion of the legislator. Whatever the issue may be, persons do not decide it for themselves; the prince decides for them. The prince is depicted as the
  <em>soul</em> of this shapeless mass of people who form the nation. In the prince resides the thought, the foresight, all progress, and the principle of all organization. Thus all responsibility rests with him.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">The whole of the tenth book of Fenelon&#39;s <i>Telemachus</i> proves this. I refer the reader to it, and content myself with quoting at random from this celebrated work to which, in every other respect, I am the

  <p style="text-align: justify">With the amazing credulity which is typical of the classicists, Fenelon ignores the authority of reason and facts when he attributes the general happiness of the Egyptians, not to their own wisdom but to the wisdom
  of their kings:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    We could not turn our eyes to either shore without seeing rich towns and country estates most agreeably located; fields, never fallowed, covered with golden crops every year; meadows full of flocks; workers bending under the weight of the fruit
    which the earth lavished upon its cultivators; shepherds who made the echoes resound with the soft notes from their pipes and flutes. &quot;Happy,&quot; said Mentor, &quot;is the people governed by a wise king....&quot;
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    Later, Mentor desired that I observe the contentment and abundance which covered all Egypt, where twenty-two thousand cities could be counted. He admired the good police regulations in the cities; the justice rendered in favor of the poor
    against the rich; the sound education of the children in obedience, labor, sobriety, and the love of the arts and letters; the exactness with which all religious ceremonies were performed; the unselfishness, the high regard for honor, the
    faithfulness to men, and the fear of the gods which every father taught his children. He never stopped admiring the prosperity of the country. &quot;Happy,&quot; said he, &quot;is the people ruled by a wise king in such a manner.&quot;

  <p style="text-align: justify">Fenelon&#39;s idyl on Crete is even more alluring. Mentor is made to say:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    All that you see in this wonderful island results from the laws of Minos. The education which he ordained for the children makes their bodies strong and robust. From the very beginning, one accustoms the children to a life of frugality and
    labor, because one assumes that all pleasures of the senses weaken both body and mind. Thus one allows them no pleasure except that of becoming invincible by virtue, and of acquiring glory.... Here one punishes three vices that go unpunished
    among other people: ingratitude, hypocrisy, and greed. There is no need to punish persons for pomp and dissipation, for they are unknown in Crete.... No costly furniture, no magnificent clothing, no delicious feasts, no gilded palaces are
    permitted.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Thus does Mentor prepare his student to mold and to manipulate &#8212; doubtless with the best of intentions &#8212; the people of Ithaca. And to convince the student of the wisdom of these ideas, Mentor recites to
  him the example of Salentum. It is from this sort of philosophy that we receive our first political ideas! We are taught to treat persons much as an instructor in agriculture teaches farmers to prepare and tend the soil.</p><a name=

  <p style="text-align: justify">Now listen to the great Montesquieu on this same subject:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    To maintain the spirit of commerce, it is necessary that all the laws must favor it. These laws, by proportionately dividing up the fortunes as they are made in commerce, should provide every poor citizen with sufficiently easy circumstances to
    enable him to work like the others. These same laws should put every rich citizen in such lowered circumstances as to force him to work in order to keep or to gain.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Thus the laws are to dispose of all fortunes!</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    Although real equality is the soul of the state in a democracy, yet this is so difficult to establish that an extreme precision in this matter would not always be desirable. It is sufficient that there be established a census to reduce or fix
    these differences in wealth within a certain limit. After this is done, it remains for specific laws to equalize inequality by imposing burdens upon the rich and granting relief to the poor.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Here again we find the idea of equalizing fortunes by law, by force.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    In Greece, there were two kinds of republics. One, Sparta, was military; the other, Athens, was commercial. In the former, <em>it was desired</em> that the citizens be idle; in the latter, love of labor <em>was encouraged</em>.

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    Note the marvelous genius of these legislators: By debasing all established customs &#8212; by mixing the usual concepts of all virtues &#8212; they knew in advance that the world would admire their wisdom.

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    Lycurgus gave stability to his city of Sparta by combining petty thievery with the soul of justice; by combining the most complete bondage with the most extreme liberty; by combining the most atrocious beliefs with the greatest moderation. He
    appeared to deprive his city of all its resources, arts, commerce, money, and defenses. In Sparta, ambition went without the hope of material reward. Natural affection found no outlet because a man was neither son, husband, nor father. Even
    chastity was no longer considered becoming. <em>By this road, Lycurgus led Sparta on to greatness and glory.</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    This boldness which was to be found in the institutions of Greece has been repeated in the midst of <em>the degeneracy and corruption of our modern times</em>. An occasional honest legislator has molded a people in whom integrity appears as
    natural as courage in the Spartans.

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    Mr. William Penn, for example, is a true Lycurgus. Even though Mr. Penn had peace as his objectivity &#8212; while Lycurgus had war as his objective they resemble each other in that their moral prestige over free men allowed them to overcome

  <p style="text-align: justify">Now let us examine Rousseau on this subject. This writer on public affairs is the supreme authority of the democrats. And although he bases the social structure upon the will <em>of the people</em>, he has, to a
  greater extent than anyone else, completely accepted the theory of the total inertness of mankind in the presence of the legislators:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    If it is true that a great prince is rare, then is it not true that a great legislator is even more rare? The prince has only to follow the pattern that the legislator creates. <em>The legislator is the mechanic who invents the machine;</em> the
    prince is merely the workman who sets it in motion.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify">And what part do persons play in all this? They are merely the machine that is set in motion. In fact, are they not merely considered to be the raw material of which the machine is made?</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Thus the same relationship exists between the legislator and the prince as exists between the agricultural expert and the farmer; and the relationship between the prince and his subjects is the same as that between
  the farmer and his land. How high above mankind, then, has this writer on public affairs been placed? Rousseau rules over legislators themselves, and teaches them their trade in these imperious terms:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    Would you give stability to the state? Then bring the extremes as closely together as possible. Tolerate neither wealthy persons nor beggars. If the soil is poor or barren, or the country too small for its inhabitants, then turn to industry and
    arts, and trade these products for the foods that you need.... On a fertile soil &#8212; if <em>you are short</em> of inhabitants &#8212; devote all your attention to agriculture, because this multiplies people; <em>banish</em> the arts, because
    they only serve to depopulate the nation....
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    If you have extensive and accessible coast lines, then <em>cover the sea</em> with merchant ships; you will have a brilliant but short existence. If your seas wash only inaccessible cliffs, let the people <em>be barbarous</em> and eat fish; they
    will live more quietly &#8212; perhaps better &#8212; and, most certainly, they will live more happily.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    In short, and in addition to the maxims that are common to all, every people has its own particular circumstances. And this fact in itself will cause legislation appropriate to the circumstances.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    This is the reason why the Hebrews formerly &#8212; and, more recently, the Arabs &#8212; had religion as their principle objective. The objective of the Athenians was literature; of Carthage and Tyre, commerce; of Rhodes, naval affairs; of
    Sparta, war; and of Rome, virtue. The author of <i>The Spirit of Laws</i> has shown by what art <em>the legislator should direct his institutions toward each of these objectives</em>.... But suppose that the legislator mistakes his proper
    objective, and acts on a principle different from that indicated by the nature of things? Suppose that the selected principle sometimes creates slavery, and sometimes liberty; sometimes wealth, and sometimes population; sometimes peace, and
    sometimes conquest? This confusion of objective will slowly enfeeble the law and impair the constitution. The state will be subjected to ceaseless agitations until it is destroyed or changed, and invincible nature regains her empire.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But if nature is sufficiently invincible to <em>regain</em> its empire, why does not Rousseau admit that it did not need the legislator to <em>gain</em> it in the first place? Why does he not see that men, by obeying
  their own instincts, would turn to farming on fertile soil, and to commerce on an extensive and easily accessible coast, without the interference of a Lycurgus or a Solon or a Rousseau <em>who might easily be mistaken</em>.</p><a name=

  <blockquote>
    On an uncultivated island that you are populating with children, you need do nothing but let the seeds of truth germinate along with the development of reason.... But when you resettle a nation with a past into a new country, the skill of the
    legislator rests in the policy of <em>permitting the people</em> to retain no injurious opinions and customs which can possibly be cured and corrected. If you desire to prevent these opinions and customs from becoming permanent, you will secure
    the second generation by a general system of public education for the children. A prince or a legislator should never establish a colony without first arranging to send wise men along to instruct the youth...

  <blockquote>
    My Lord, assume the character of Lycurgus or of Solon. And before you finish reading this essay, amuse yourself by giving laws to some savages in America or Africa. Confine these nomads to fixed dwellings; teach them to tend flocks.... Attempt
    to develop the social consciousness that nature has planted in them.... Force them to begin to practice the duties of humanity.... Use punishment to cause sensual pleasures to become distasteful to them. Then you will see that every point of
    your legislation will cause these savages to lose a vice and gain a virtue.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    All people have had laws. But few people have been happy. Why is this so? Because the legislators themselves have almost always been ignorant of the purpose of society, which is the uniting of families by a common interest.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    Impartiality in law consists of two things: the establishing of equality in wealth and equality in dignity among the citizens.... As the laws establish greater equality, they become proportionately more precious to every citizen.... When all men
    are equal in wealth and dignity &#8212; and when the laws leave no hope of disturbing this equality &#8212; how can men then be agitated by greed, ambition, dissipation, idleness, sloth, envy, hatred, or jealousy?

  <p style="text-align: justify">Actually, it is <em>not</em> strange that during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the human race was regarded as inert matter, ready to receive everything &#8212; form, face, energy, movement, life &#8212;
  from a great prince or a great legislator or a great genius. These centuries were nourished on the study of antiquity. And antiquity presents everywhere &#8212; in Egypt, Persia, Greece, Rome &#8212; the spectacle of a few men molding mankind
  according to their whims, thanks to the prestige of force and of fraud. But this does not prove that this situation is desirable. It proves only that since men and society are capable of improvement, it is naturally to be expected that error,
  ignorance, despotism, slavery, and superstition should be greatest towards the origins of history. The writers quoted above were not in error when they found ancient institutions to be such, but they were in error when they offered them for the
  admiration and imitation of future generations. Uncritical and childish conformists, they took for granted the grandeur, dignity, morality, and happiness of the artificial societies of the ancient world. They did not understand that knowledge
  appears and grows with the passage of time; and that in proportion to this growth of knowledge, <em>might</em> takes the side of <em>right</em>, and society regains possession of itself.</p><a name="SECTION_G053"></a>

  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Actually, what is the political struggle that we witness? It is the instinctive struggle of all people toward liberty. And what is this liberty, whose very name makes the heart beat faster and shakes the world? Is it
  not the union of all liberties &#8212; liberty of conscience, of education, of association, of the press, of travel, of labor, of trade? In short, is not liberty the freedom of every person to make full use of his faculties, so long as he does not
  harm other persons while doing so? Is not liberty the destruction of all despotism &#8212; including, of course, legal despotism? Finally, is not liberty the restricting of the law only to its rational sphere of organizing the right of the
  individual to lawful self-defense; of punishing injustice?</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">It must be admitted that the tendency of the human race toward liberty is largely thwarted, especially in France. This is greatly due to a fatal desire &#8212; learned from the teachings of antiquity &#8212; that our
  writers on public affairs have in common: They desire to set themselves above mankind in order to arrange, organize, and regulate it according to their fancy.</p><a name="SECTION_G054"></a>

    </tr>
  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">While society is struggling toward liberty, these famous men who put themselves at its head are filled with the spirit of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They think only of subjecting mankind to the
  philanthropic tyranny of their own social inventions. Like Rousseau, they desire to force mankind docilely to bear this yoke of the public welfare that they have dreamed up in their own imaginations.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">This was especially true in 1789. No sooner was the old regime destroyed than society was subjected to still other artificial arrangements, always starting from the same point: the omnipotence of the law.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Listen to the ideas of a few of the writers and politicians during that period:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    SAINT-JUST: The legislator commands the future. It is for him to <em>will</em> the good of mankind. It is for him to make men what <em>he wills</em> them to be.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    ROBESPIERRE: The function of government is to direct the physical and moral powers of the nation toward the end for which the commonwealth has come into being.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    BILLAUD-VARENNES: A people who are to be returned to liberty must be formed anew. A strong force and vigorous action are necessary to destroy old prejudices, to change old customs, to correct depraved affections, to restrict superfluous wants,
    and to destroy ingrained vices.... Citizens, the inflexible austerity of Lycurgus created the firm foundation of the Spartan republic. The weak and trusting character of Solon plunged Athens into slavery. This parallel embraces the whole science
    of government.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    LE PELLETIER: Considering the extent of human degradation, I am convinced that it is necessary to effect a total regeneration and, if I may so express myself, of creating a new people.

  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Again, it is claimed that persons are nothing but raw material. It is not for them to will <em>their own improvement</em>; they are incapable of it. According to Saint-Just, only the legislator is capable of doing
  this. Persons are merely to be what the legislator <em>wills</em> them to be. According to Robespierre, who copies Rousseau literally, the legislator begins by decreeing the <em>end for which the commonwealth has come into being</em>. Once this is
  determined, the government has only to direct <em>the physical and moral forces of the nation</em> toward that end. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the nation are to remain completely passive. And according to the teachings of Billaud-Varennes, the
  people should have no prejudices, no affections, and no desires except those authorized by the legislator. He even goes so far as to say that the inflexible austerity of one man is the foundation of a republic.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">In cases where the alleged evil is so great that ordinary governmental procedures cannot cure it, Mably recommends a dictatorship to promote virtue: &quot;Resort,&quot; he says, &quot;to an extraordinary tribunal
  with considerable powers for a short time. The imagination of the citizens needs to be struck a hard blow.&quot; This doctrine has not been forgotten. Listen to Robespierre:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    The principle of the republican government is virtue, and the means required to establish virtue is terror. In our country we desire to substitute morality for selfishness, honesty for honor, principles for customs, duties for manners, the
    empire of reason for the tyranny of fashion, contempt of vice for contempt of poverty, pride for insolence, greatness of soul for vanity, love of glory for love of money, good people for good companions, merit for intrigue, genius for wit, truth
    for glitter, the charm of happiness for the boredom of pleasure, the greatness of man for the littleness of the great, a generous, strong, happy people for a good-natured, frivolous, degraded people; in short, we desire to substitute all the
    virtues and miracles of a republic for all the vices and absurdities of a monarchy.

  he expect such a result from a well-ordered government. No, he himself will remake mankind, and by means of terror.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">This mass of rotten and contradictory statements is extracted from a discourse by Robespierre in which he aims to explain the <em>principles of morality which ought to guide a revolutionary government</em>. Note that
  Robespierre&#39;s request for dictatorship is not made merely for the purpose of repelling a foreign invasion or putting down the opposing groups. Rather he wants a dictatorship in order that he may use terror to force upon the country his own
  principles of morality. He says that this act is only to be a temporary measure preceding a new constitution. But in reality, he desires nothing short of using terror to extinguish from France <em>selfishness, honor, customs, manners, fashion,
  vanity, love of money, good companionship, intrigue, wit, sensuousness, and poverty</em>. Not until he, Robespierre, shall have accomplished these <em>miracles</em>, as he so rightly calls them, will he permit the law to reign again.</p>

    (At this point in the original French text, Mr. Bastiat pauses and speaks thusly to all do-gooders and would-be rulers of mankind: &quot;Ah, you miserable creatures! You who think that you are so great! You who judge humanity to be so small! You

  <p style="text-align: justify">It is, of course, not at all surprising that this same idea should have greatly appealed to Napoleon. He embraced it ardently and used it with vigor. Like a chemist, Napoleon considered all Europe to be material for
  his experiments. But, in due course, this material reacted against him.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">At St. Helena, Napoleon &#8212; greatly disillusioned &#8212; seemed to recognize some initiative in mankind. Recognizing this, he became less hostile to liberty. Nevertheless, this did not prevent him from leaving
  this lesson to his son in his will: &quot;To govern is to increase and spread morality, education, and happiness.&quot;</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">After all this, it is hardly necessary to quote the same opinions from Morelly, Babeuf, Owen, Saint-Simon, and Fourier. Here are, however, a few extracts from Louis Blanc&#39;s book on the organization of labor:
  &quot;In our plan, society receives its momentum from power.&quot;</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Now consider this: The impulse behind this momentum is to be supplied by the <em>plan</em> of Louis Blanc; his plan is to be forced upon society; the society referred to is the human race. Thus the human race is to
  receive its momentum from Louis Blanc.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Now it will be said that the people are free to accept or to reject this plan. Admittedly, people are free to accept or to reject <em>advice</em> from whomever they wish. But this is not the way in which Mr. Louis
  Blanc understands the matter. He expects that his plan will be legalized, and thus forcibly imposed upon the people by the power of the law:</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    In our plan, the state has only to pass labor laws (nothing else?) by means of which industrial progress can and must proceed in complete liberty. The state merely places society on an incline (that is all?). Then society will slide down this
    incline by the mere force of things, and by the natural workings of the established mechanism.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But what is this incline that is indicated by Mr. Louis Blanc? Does it not lead to an abyss? (No, it leads to happiness.) If this is true, then why does not society go there of its own choice? (Because society does
  not know what it wants; it must be propelled.) What is to propel it? (Power.) And who is to supply the impulse for this power? (Why, the inventor of the machine &#8212; in this instance, Mr. Louis Blanc.)</p><a name="SECTION_G059"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    Once and for all, liberty is not only a mere granted right; it is also the power granted to a person to use and to develop his faculties under a reign of justice and under the protection of the law.
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    And this is no pointless distinction; its meaning is deep and its consequences are difficult to estimate. For once it is agreed that a person, to be truly free, must have the power to use and develop his faculties, then it follows that every
    person has a claim on society for such education as will <em>permit him</em> to develop himself. It also follows that every person has a claim on society for tools of production, without which human activity cannot be fully effective. Now by
    what action can society give to every person the necessary education and the necessary tools of production, if not by the action of the state?
  </blockquote>

  <p style="text-align: justify"></p>

  <blockquote>
    Thus, again, liberty is power. Of what does this power consist? (Of being educated and of being given the tools of production.) Who is to give the education and the tools of production? (Society, <em>which owes them to everyone.</em>) By what
    action is society to give tools of production to those who do not own them? (Why, by <em>the action of the state</em>.) And from whom will the state take them?

    </tr>
  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">The strange phenomenon of our times &#8212; one which will probably astound our descendants &#8212; is the doctrine based on this triple hypothesis: the total inertness of mankind, the omnipotence of the law, and the
  infallibility of the legislator. These three ideas form the sacred symbol of those who proclaim themselves totally democratic.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">The advocates of this doctrine also profess to be <em>social</em>. So far as they are democratic, they place unlimited faith in mankind. But so far as they are social, they regard mankind as little better than mud.
  Let us examine this contrast in greater detail.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">What is the attitude of the democrat when political rights are under discussion? How does he regard the people when a legislator is to be chosen? Ah, then it is claimed that the people have an instinctive wisdom;
  they are gifted with the finest perception; their will is always right; the general will cannot err; voting cannot be too universal.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">When it is time to vote, apparently the voter is not to be asked for any guarantee of his wisdom. His will and capacity to choose wisely are taken for granted. Can the people be mistaken? Are we not living in an age
  of enlightenment? What! are the people always to be kept on leashes? Have they not won their rights by great effort and sacrifice? Have they not given ample proof of their intelligence and wisdom? Are they not adults? Are they not capable of
  judging for themselves? Do they not know what is best for themselves? Is there a class or a man who would be so bold as to set himself above the people, and judge and act for them? No, no, the people are and should be <em>free</em>. They desire to
  manage their own affairs, and they shall do so.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But when the legislator is finally elected &#8212; ah! then indeed does the tone of his speech undergo a radical change. The people are returned to passiveness, inertness, and unconsciousness; the legislator enters
  into omnipotence. Now it is for him to initiate, to direct, to propel, and to organize. Mankind has only to submit; the hour of despotism has struck. We now observe this fatal idea: The people who, during the election, were so wise, so moral, and
  so perfect, now have no tendencies whatever; or if they have any, they are tendencies that lead downward into degradation.</p><a name="SECTION_G061"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But ought not the people be given a little liberty?</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But Mr. Considerant has assured us that <em>liberty leads inevitably to monopoly!</em></p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">We understand that liberty means competition. But according to Mr. Louis Blanc, <em>competition is a system that ruins the businessmen and exterminates the people</em>. It is for this reason that free people are
  ruined and exterminated in proportion to their degree of freedom. (Possibly Mr. Louis Blanc should observe the results of competition in, for example, Switzerland, Holland, England, and the United States.)</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Mr. Louis Blanc also tells us that <em>competition leads to monopoly</em>. And by the same reasoning, he thus informs us that <em>low prices lead to high prices;</em> that <em>competition drives production to
  destructive activity;</em> that <em>competition drains away the sources of purchasing power;</em> that <em>competition forces an increase in production while, at the same time, it forces a decrease in consumption</em>. From this, it follows that
  free people produce for the sake of not consuming; that liberty means <em>oppression and madness</em> among the people; and that Mr. Louis Blanc absolutely must attend to it.</p><a name="SECTION_G062"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Well, what liberty should the legislators permit people to have? Liberty of conscience? (But if this were permitted, we would see the people taking this opportunity to become atheists.)</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Then liberty of education? (But parents would pay professors to teach their children immorality and falsehoods; besides, according to Mr. Thiers, if education were left to national liberty, it would cease to be
  national, and we would be teaching our children the ideas of the Turks or Hindus; whereas, thanks to this legal despotism over education, our children now have the good fortune to be taught the noble ideas of the Romans.)</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Then liberty of labor? (But that would mean competition which, in turn, leaves production unconsumed, ruins businessmen, and exterminates the people.)</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Perhaps liberty of trade? (But everyone knows &#8212; and the advocates of protective tariffs have proved over and over again &#8212; that freedom of trade ruins every person who engages in it, and that it is
  necessary to suppress freedom of trade in order to prosper.)</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Possibly then, liberty of association? (But, according to socialist doctrine, true liberty and voluntary association are in contradiction to each other, and the purpose of the socialists is to suppress liberty of
  association precisely in order to force people to associate together in true liberty.)</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Clearly then, the conscience of the social democrats cannot permit persons to have any liberty because they believe that the nature of mankind tends always toward every kind of degradation and disaster. Thus, of
  course, the legislators must make plans for the people in order to save them from themselves.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">This line of reasoning brings us to a challenging question: If people are as incapable, as immoral, and as ignorant as the politicians indicate, then why is the right of these same people to vote defended with such

  than the rest of mankind? The organizers maintain that society, when left undirected, rushes headlong to its inevitable destruction because the instincts of the people are so perverse. The legislators claim to stop this suicidal course and to give
  it a saner direction. Apparently, then, the legislators and the organizers have received from Heaven an intelligence and virtue that place them beyond and above mankind; if so, let them show their titles to this superiority.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">They would be the shepherds over us, their sheep. Certainly such an arrangement presupposes that they are naturally superior to the rest of us. And certainly we are fully justified in demanding from the legislators

  <p style="text-align: justify">If we are fortunate, then government has a claim to our gratitude; but if we are unfortunate, then government must bear the blame. For are not our persons and property now at the disposal of government? Is not the
  law omnipotent?</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">In creating a monopoly of education, the government must answer to the hopes of the fathers of families who have thus been deprived of their liberty; and if these hopes are shattered, whose fault is it? In regulating
  industry, the government has contracted to make it prosper; otherwise it is absurd to deprive industry of its liberty. And if industry now suffers, whose fault is it?</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">In meddling with the balance of trade by playing with tariffs, the government thereby contracts to make trade prosper; and if this results in destruction instead of prosperity, whose fault is it?</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">A science of economics must be developed before a science of politics can be logically formulated. Essentially, economics is the science of determining whether the interests of human beings are harmonious or
  antagonistic. This must be known before a science of politics can be formulated to determine the proper functions of government.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Immediately following the development of a science of economics, and at the very beginning of the formulation of a science of politics, this all-important question must be answered: What is law? What ought it to be?
  What is its scope; its limits? Logically, at what point do the just powers of the legislator stop?</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">I do not hesitate to answer: <em>Law is the common force organized to act as an obstacle of injustice</em>. In short, <em>law is justice</em>.</p><a name="SECTION_G068"></a>

      <td style="background-color: #CCFFB8; font-weight: bold" valign="top">Proper Legislative Functions</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">It is not true that the legislator has absolute power over our persons and property. The existence of persons and property preceded the existence of the legislator, and his function is only to guarantee their
  safety.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">It is not true that the function of law is to regulate our consciences, our ideas, our wills, our education, our opinions, our work, our trade, our talents, or our pleasures. The function of law is to protect the
  free exercise of these rights, and to prevent any person from interfering with the free exercise of these same rights by any other person.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Since law necessarily requires the support of force, its lawful domain is only in the areas where the use of force is necessary. This is justice.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Every individual has the right to use force for lawful self-defense. It is for this reason that the collective force &#8212; which is only the organized combination of the individual forces &#8212; may lawfully be
  used for the same purpose; and it cannot be used legitimately for any other purpose.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Law is solely the organization of the individual right of self-defense which existed before law was formalized. Law is justice.</p><a name="SECTION_G069"></a>

      <td style="background-color: #CCFFB8; font-weight: bold" valign="top">Law and Charity Are Not the Same</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">The mission of the law is <em>not</em> to oppress persons and plunder them of their property, even though the law may be acting in a philanthropic spirit. Its mission is to protect persons and property.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Furthermore, it must not be said that the law may be philanthropic if, in the process, it refrains from oppressing persons and plundering them of their property; this would be a contradiction. The law cannot avoid
  having an effect upon persons and property; and if the law acts in any manner except to protect them, its actions then necessarily violate the liberty of persons and their right to own property.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">The law is justice &#8212; simple and clear, precise and bounded. Every eye can see it, and every mind can grasp it; for justice is measurable, immutable, and unchangeable. Justice is neither more than this nor less
  than this. If you exceed this proper limit &#8212; if you attempt to make the law religious, fraternal, equalizing, philanthropic, industrial, literary, or artistic &#8212; you will then be lost in an uncharted territory, in vagueness and
  uncertainty, in a forced utopia or, even worse, in a multitude of utopias, each striving to seize the law and impose it upon you. This is true because fraternity and philanthropy, unlike justice, do not have precise limits. Once started, where
  will you stop? And where will the law stop itself?</p><a name="SECTION_G070"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Mr. de Saint-Cricq would extend his philanthropy only to some of the industrial groups; he would demand that the law <em>control the consumers to benefit the producers.</em></p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Mr. Considerant would sponsor the cause of the labor groups; he would use the law to secure for them <em>a guaranteed minimum of clothing, housing, food, and all other necessities of life.</em></p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Mr. Louis Blanc would say &#8212; and with reason &#8212; that these minimum guarantees are merely the beginning of complete fraternity; he would say that the law should give tools of production and free education to
  all working people.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Another person would observe that this arrangement would still leave room for inequality; he would claim that the law should give to everyone even in the most inaccessible hamlet &#8212; luxury, literature, and
  art.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">All of these proposals are the high road to communism; legislation will then be &#8212; in fact, it already is &#8212; the battlefield for the fantasies and greed of everyone.</p><a name="SECTION_G071"></a>

    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: #CCFFB8; font-weight: bold" valign="top">The Basis for Stable Government</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Law is justice. In this proposition a simple and enduring government can be conceived. And I defy anyone to say how even the thought of revolution, of insurrection, of the slightest uprising could arise against a
  government whose organized force was confined only to suppressing injustice.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Under such a regime, there would be the most prosperity &#8212; and it would be the most equally distributed. As for the sufferings that are inseparable from humanity, no one would even think of accusing the
  government for them. This is true because, if the force of government were limited to suppressing injustice, then government would be as innocent of these sufferings as it is now innocent of changes in the temperature.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">As proof of this statement, consider this question: Have the people ever been known to rise against the Court of Appeals, or mob a Justice of the Peace, in order to get higher wages, free credit, tools of production,
  favorable tariffs, or government-created jobs? Everyone knows perfectly well that such matters are not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals or a Justice of the Peace. And if government were limited to its proper functions, everyone
  would soon learn that these matters are not within the jurisdiction of the law itself.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">But make the laws upon the principle of fraternity &#8212; proclaim that all good, and all bad, stem from the law; that the law is responsible for all individual misfortunes and all social inequalities &#8212; then
  the door is open to an endless succession of complaints, irritations, troubles, and revolutions.</p><a name="SECTION_G072"></a>

    </tr>
  </table>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Law is justice. And it would indeed be strange if law could properly be anything else! Is not justice right? Are not rights equal? By what right does the law force me to conform to the social plans of Mr. Mimerel,
  Mr. de Melun, Mr. Thiers, or Mr. Louis Blanc? If the law has a moral right to do this, why does it not, then, force these gentlemen to submit to <em>my plans</em>? Is it logical to suppose that nature has not given <em>me</em> sufficient
  imagination to dream up a utopia also? Should the law choose one fantasy among many, and put the organized force of government at its service only?</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Law is justice. And let it not be said &#8212; as it continually is said &#8212; that under this concept, the law would be atheistic, individualistic, and heartless; that it would make mankind in its own image. This
  is an absurd conclusion, worthy only of those worshippers of government who believe that the law <em>is</em> mankind.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Nonsense! Do those worshippers of government believe that free persons will cease to act? Does it follow that if we receive no energy from the law, we shall receive no energy at all? Does it follow that if the law is
  restricted to the function of protecting the free use of our faculties, we will be unable to use our faculties? Suppose that the law does not force us to follow certain forms of religion, or systems of association, or methods of education, or
  regulations of labor, or regulations of trade, or plans for charity; does it then follow that we shall eagerly plunge into atheism, hermitary, ignorance, misery, and greed? If we are free, does it follow that we shall no longer recognize the power
  and goodness of God? Does it follow that we shall then cease to associate with each other, to help each other, to love and succor our unfortunate brothers, to study the secrets of nature, and to strive to improve ourselves to the best of our
  abilities?</p><a name="SECTION_G073"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Law is justice. And it is under the law of justice &#8212; under the reign of right; under the influence of liberty, safety, stability, and responsibility &#8212; that every person will attain his real worth and the
  true dignity of his being. It is only under this law of justice that mankind will achieve &#8212; slowly, no doubt, but certainly &#8212; God&#39;s design for the orderly and peaceful progress of humanity.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">It seems to me that this is theoretically right, for whatever the question under discussion &#8212; whether religious, philosophical, political, or economic; whether it concerns prosperity, morality, equality, right,
  justice, progress, responsibility, cooperation, property, labor, trade, capital, wages, taxes, population, finance, or government &#8212; at whatever point on the scientific horizon I begin my researches, I invariably reach this one conclusion:
  The solution to the problems of human relationships is to be found in liberty.</p><a name="SECTION_G074"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">And does not experience prove this? Look at the entire world. Which countries contain the most peaceful, the most moral, and the happiest people? Those people are found in the countries where the law least interferes
  with private affairs; where government is least felt; where the individual has the greatest scope, and free opinion the greatest influence; where administrative powers are fewest and simplest; where taxes are lightest and most nearly equal, and
  popular discontent the least excited and the least justifiable; where individuals and groups most actively assume their responsibilities, and, consequently, where the morals of admittedly imperfect human beings are constantly improving; where
  trade, assemblies, and associations are the least restricted; where labor, capital, and populations suffer the fewest forced displacements; where mankind most nearly follows its own natural inclinations; where the inventions of men are most nearly
  in harmony with the laws of God; in short, the happiest, most moral, and most peaceful people are those who most nearly follow this principle: Although mankind is not perfect, still, all hope rests upon the free and voluntary actions of persons
  within the limits of right; law or force is to be used for nothing except the administration of universal justice.</p><a name="SECTION_G075"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">This must be said: There are too many &quot;great&quot; men in the world &#8212; legislators, organizers, do-gooders, leaders of the people, fathers of nations, and so on, and so on. Too many persons place themselves
  above mankind; they make a career of organizing it, patronizing it, and ruling it.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">Now someone will say: &quot;You yourself are doing this very thing.&quot; True. But it must be admitted that I act in an entirely different sense; if I have joined the ranks of the reformers, it is solely for the
  purpose of persuading them to leave people alone. I do not look upon people as Vancauson looked upon his automaton. Rather, just as the physiologist accepts the human body as it is, so do I accept people as they are. I desire only to study and
  admire.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">My attitude toward all other persons is well illustrated by this story from a celebrated traveler: He arrived one day in the midst of a tribe of savages, where a child had just been born. A crowd of soothsayers,
  magicians, and quacks &#8212; armed with rings, hooks, and cords &#8212; surrounded it. One said: &quot;This child will never smell the perfume of a peace-pipe unless I stretch his nostrils.&quot; Another said: &quot;He will never be able to hear
  unless I draw his ear-lobes down to his shoulders.&quot; A third said: &quot;He will never see the sunshine unless I slant his eyes.&quot; Another said: &quot;He will never stand upright unless I bend his legs.&quot; A fifth said: &quot;He will
  never learn to think unless I flatten his skull.&quot;</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">&quot;Stop,&quot; cried the traveler. &quot;What God does is well done. Do not claim to know more than He. God has given organs to this frail creature; let them develop and grow strong by exercise, use, experience,
  and liberty.&quot;</p><a name="SECTION_G076"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify">God has given to men all that is necessary for them to accomplish their destinies. He has provided a social form as well as a human form. And these social organs of persons are so constituted that they will develop
  themselves harmoniously in the clean air of liberty. Away, then, with quacks and organizers! A way with their rings, chains, hooks, and pincers! Away with their artificial systems! Away with the whims of governmental administrators, their
  socialized projects, their centralization, their tariffs, their government schools, their state religions, their free credit, their bank monopolies, their regulations, their restrictions, their equalization by taxation, and their pious
  moralizations!</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">And now that the legislators and do-gooders have so futilely inflicted so many systems upon society, may they finally end where they should have begun: May they reject all systems, and try liberty; for liberty is an
  acknowledgment of faith in God and His works.</p>

  appear to represent <em>all persons who labor</em>. Instinctively, they feel that legal plunder is concealed by generalizing it.</p>
